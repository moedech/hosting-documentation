# FTP Service

This service will install and configure ProFTPD and manage virtual users.

Warning: Use FTP only if really required (for example for webcam access). Most use cases are just fine with SSH/SCP.


## Users

* adds a FTP User
* password: crypt password as used in /etc/passwd
* uid: Linux system user id of desired user. Lookup on server before adding.
* gid: Linux system group id of desired group. Lookup on server before adding.
* home: access is restricted to this directory

```
ftp::users:
  "alice":
    "password": "$6$1sLLOf5.$GAZDHYXEjs0MpR5uHBAR5eD00MpUasTgbyIP27PZ8WprL98XeU01N502ogYn1JKrgqEiTXn1/lkFBNZ46zZHY/"
    "uid":      "1005"
    "gid":      "1005"
    "home":     "/home/examplenet/www/webcam/"
```

Hint: The password has to be encrypted. Use the following command to encrypt your desired password: `mkpasswd -m sha-512`

Hint: Use the "id" command to determine the appropriate uid/gid

Note: Access is enabled by both FTP and FTPS. Use the server FQDN to connect by FTPS as we use the *.snowflakehosting.ch wildcard certificate by default


## Directories

* add custom per directory options
* see ProFTPD Documentation for Details: http://www.proftpd.org/docs/

```
ftp::directories:
  "/home/examplenet/tmp/":
    "limit":
      "WRITE":
        "DenyAll":
        "AllowUser": "alice"
```

will led to this ProFTPD configuration:

```
<Directory /home/examplenet/tmp/>
	<Limit WRITE>
		DenyAll undef
		AllowUser alice
	</Limit>
</Directory>
```
