# Firewall Service

Note: This site belongs to the IP firewall. There is also a web application firewall which is described within the [website service](/services/website.md#Web_Application_Firewall)


## Default settings

By default, all incoming and outgoing traffic is blocked, expect the following:

 * related or established connections
 * ICMP/ICMPv6
 * Traceroute
 * SSH


## Custom rules trough service

Where applicable, all services add the approriate firewall rules automatically, for example:

 * website module will allow HTTP/HTTPS
 * mysql type in database module will allow mysql from admin server


## Custom rules

You can also add custom rules.

Where applicable, both IPv4 and IPv6 Rules are added by default (For example INPUT chains for a particular Port).

Warning: Try your best to avoid such custom rules. For outgoing connections, use our Proxy Servers instead (see below)

### Allow

```
base::firewall::rules:
  "020 accept Puppet to puppetmaster":
    "port":         "8140"
    "destination":  "192.168.0.22"
    "destination6": "2001:db8::22"
  "021 accept HTTP to Package Server":
    "port":         "80"
    "destination":  "192.168.0.21"
  "040 accept incoming HTTP":
    "chain":        "INPUT"
    "port":         "80"
```

### Deny

You can add custom rules to deny services, too:

```
base::firewall::rules:
  "020 deny HTTP because we want to force a secure site with HTTPS only":
    "chain":  "INPUT"
    "port":   "80"
    "action": "rejected"
```
Hint: HTTP(S) nginx rules are numbered 040 so you must use a lower number for your rule to be processed before the default allow all from nginx-configuration

## Outgoing proxy

Outgoing requests of all kind are blocked due to safety reason.

Server within the snowflakehosting.ch Zone can use the provided Proxy to Access external Resources:

```
proxy.snowflakehosting.ch:80
```

This proxy is already configured trough global Environment Variables for both System and Webserver.

Hint: Make sure to use curl within PHP which will respect those Variables by default


### Example usage

#### TYPO3

To configure the TYPO3 CMS to take advantage of the proxy, set the following option in your LocalConfiguration.php or AdditionalConfiguration.php:

```
/*
 * Set http proxy if available 
 */

if ($_SERVER['http_proxy'] && strlen($_SERVER['http_proxy']) > 1) {
        $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SYS']['curlProxyServer'] = $_SERVER['http_proxy'];
}

```

Please also remember to enable the usage of cURL in your conf vars sys section:
```
'curlUse' => '1'
```

Hint: don`t forget to use the TYPO3 getURL() and other core functions in your custom build extensions. Otherwise the proxy settings do not work.

#### Magento

To configure Magneto to use the proxy, set the following options in your downloader/lib/Mage/HTTP/Client/Curl.php file:

```
protected function makeRequest($method, $uri, $params = array(), $isAuthorizationRequired = false, $https = true)
    {
        $uriModified = $this->getModifiedUri($uri, $https);
        $this->_ch = curl_init();
        $this->curlOption(CURLOPT_PROXY, "http://proxy.snowflakehosting.ch:80");
        $this->curlOption(CURLOPT_URL, $uriModified);
        $this->curlOption(CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, false);
        $this->curlOption(CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST, 2);
        $this->getCurlMethodSettings($method, $params, $isAuthorizationRequired); 
       ...
	}
```

And if you use Zend, set the following options in: lib/Zend/Http/Client/Adapter/Proxy.php 
```
class Zend_Http_Client_Adapter_Proxy extends Zend_Http_Client_Adapter_Socket
{
    /**
     * Parameters array
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $config = array(
        'ssltransport'  => 'ssl',
        'sslcert'       => null,
        'sslpassphrase' => null,
        'sslusecontext' => false,
        'proxy_host'    => 'http://proxy.snowflakehosting.ch',
        'proxy_port'    => 80,
        'proxy_user'    => '',
        'proxy_pass'    => '',
        'proxy_auth'    => Zend_Http_Client::AUTH_BASIC,
        'persistent'    => false
    );
...
}

```

#### Wordpress

To configure Wordpress to use the proxy, set the following options in your wp-config.php file:
```
define('WP_PROXY_HOST', 'proxy.snowflakehosting.ch');
define('WP_PROXY_PORT', '80');
define('WP_PROXY_BYPASS_HOSTS', 'localhost');
```
