# RabbitMQ Service

Install RabbitMQ and enable messaging for your favorite applications.

## Install

To install a preconfigured RabbitMQ, add the service to your server:

```
# additional Puppet Modules
base::modules:
  - "rabbitmq"
```

## User add

Simply add a new user over hiera:

```
# RabbitMQ Configuration
base::rabbitmq::user:
  "username":
    "admin":    "true"
    "password": "haVah2vohQuoosait1Th"
```

## Firewall rules

Don't forget to add the [firewall rules](firewall.md) to access RabbitMQ from your application.
For example add:

```
# allow Access to RabbitMQ from xy
base::firewall::rules:
  "101 accept RabbitMQ from xy":
    "chain":   "INPUT"
    "port":    "5672"
    "source":  "91.234.160.xy"
    "source6": "2a04:503:0:105::1:xy"
